= Webclients Comparison

== Ktor Client

The Ktor client is a facade for different backends like Apache, OkHttp and JDK.

* + different backends and backend specific engine config possible
* + many plugins for easy authentication, logging or timeouts
* - complex configuration looks a bit messy
* + simple requests are very slim
* - response code validation is strange

== OkHttp Client

* - No JSON integration, ObjectMapper has to be used
